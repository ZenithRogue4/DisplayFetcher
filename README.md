# DisplayFetcher

This program fetches display information.

Information Shown:
    - Display Name
    - Display Connection (Internal, HDMI, DP, etc.)
    - Set Resolution
    - Max Resolution
    - Refresh Rate

For now, this will only show information about the main display. I hope to have information about all connected displays in the future.
